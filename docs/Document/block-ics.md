# [ics] block
The block `[ics]` is used to apply the initial condition for the DoFs. This block's layout looks as follows:
```
[ics]
  [ic1]
    type=const
    dof=dof1
    domain=domain-name
    params=val1 val2 ...
  [end]
  ...
[end]
```
## options
The `type =` option specifies the name of the initial condition type one wants to use.

`dof=` specifies the name of the DoF.

`domain=` indicates the domain name where the initial condition will be applied.

`params=` gives the parameters which will be used in the initial condition calculation.
