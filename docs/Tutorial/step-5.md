# Introduction
In this step, we will try to solve the [CahnHilliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation) equation for the spinodal decomposition problem.

# The CahnHilliard equation
The CahnHilliard equation can be read as follows:
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=\nabla\cdot(M(c)\nabla\mu)
\label{eq:ch-c}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}
$$
and
$$
\begin{equation}
\mu=\frac{\delta f}{\delta c}
\label{eq:ch-mu}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}
$$
where $c$ and $\mu$ denote the concentration and chemical potential, respectively. $M(c)$ is the concentration dependent mobility, in this model we use $M(c)=Dc(1-c)$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

## Free energy
In this model, we use the following free energy:
$$
\begin{equation}
f=c\ln(c)+(1-c)\ln(1-c)+\chi c(1-c)+\kappa|\nabla c|^{2}
\label{eq:free-energy}
\tag{3}
\end{equation}
$$
thereby, the chemical potential $\mu$ can be expressed as:
$$
\begin{equation}
\mu=\ln(c)-\ln(1-c)+\chi(1-c)-\kappa\nabla^{2}c
\label{eq:mu}
\tag{4}
\end{equation}
$$
where $\chi$ denotes the interaction between two phases. $\kappa$ represents the interface energy contribution, which is proportional to the thickness of the phase interface.

The related boundary conditions can be read as:
$$
\begin{equation}
-D\nabla c\cdot\vec{n}=0\qquad\mathrm{on}\quad\partial\Omega_{N}
\label{eq:flux}
\tag{5}
\end{equation}
$$
where the zero flux (*Neumann*) boundary condition is assumed in Eq.$\eqref{eq:flux}$.

# Define the mesh
We use a square domain here for our calculation, and then the `[mesh]` block can be given as:
```
[mesh]
  type=asfem
  dim=2
  xmax=4.0
  ymax=4.0
  nx=100
  ny=100
  meshtype=quad4
[end]
```
where a $4\times4$ mesh is defined.

## Gauss point integration (optional)
If one wants to use second order mesh, for instance `meshtype=quad9`, then one need to use a higher order gauss points. This can be implemented via:
```
[qpoint]
  type=gauss
  order=3
[end]
```
Normally, you don't need this block!

# Define the DoFs
In order to solve the 4th order equation, we split the CH equation into two second-order equations. Therefore, the DoFs used in this step are the concentration $c$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. Then the `[dofs]` block can be read as:
```
[dofs]
name=c mu
[end]
```

# Element for the CahnHilliard equation
The model in Eq.$\eqref{eq:ch-c}$ and $\eqref{eq:ch-mu}$ can be applied in the following lines
```
[elmts]
  [mych]
    type=cahnhilliard
    dofs=c mu
    mate=myf
  [end]
[end]
```
where `type=cahnhilliard` option specifies the element we want to use for the CahnHilliard equation. Moreover, we will use the `free energy`($F$), the `first order` derivative of free energy($\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}$), and the `second order` derivative of free energy($\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial c^{2}}$) material properties. Therefore, the related material definition will be given in `myf` block.

## free energy material
Via the following lines in your `[mates]` block, the material properties, i.e. $F$, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}$, and $\frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial c^{2}}$ can be easily defined:
```
[mates]
  [myf]
    type=cahnhilliard
    params=1.0 2.5 0.005
  [end]
[end]
```
where `type=cahnhilliard` specifies constant diffusivity material type. Don't worry, here we used the same name as the `type=` in `[elmts]` block. But AsFem knows that they belong to two different blocks, so it's fine. `params=` defines the diffusivity $D=1.0$, the phase interaction constant $\chi=2.5$, and the interface parameter $\kappa=0.02$. If you are using a coarse mesh, please increase $\kappa$ to a larger value, i.e. 0.02 or even higher.

# Boundary conditions
Since the zero flux boundary condition is applied, we don't need any `[bcs]` block. If Eq.$\eqref{eq:flux}$ is nonzero, then you will definitely need the `[bcs]` block.


# Transient analysis
Again, we need a `[job]` block to start the FEM calculation, which can be given as follows:
```
[job]
  type=transient
  debug=dep
[end]
```

# Timestepping
In this case, we will use the adaptive time stepping to speed up our simulation. The layout of our `[timestepping]` block looks like below:
```
[timestepping]
  type=be
  dt=1.0e-5
  time=1.0e3
  adaptive=true
  optiters=3
  growthfactor=1.1
  cutfactor=0.85
[end]
```
where `type=be` specifies the *Backward-Euler* (be) method for implicit time integration. `dt=1.0e-5` defines that the initial $\Delta_{t}$ and `time=1.0e3` means the final time is 1000.0. `adaptive=true` enables the adaptive time stepping. `optiters=3` indicates that if the nonlinear iterations is not greater than 3, then AsFem will increase the new delta t to be $\Delta_{t}=\Delta_{t,\mathrm{old}}*\alpha_{\mathrm{growth}}$. Otherwise, the new delta t will be reduced as $\Delta_{t}=\Delta_{t,\mathrm{old}}*\alpha_{\mathrm{cut}}$. `growthfactor` and `cutfactor` represent $\alpha_{\mathrm{growth}}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{cut}}$, respectively.

# Initial condition
Now, in order to allow the phase separation to take place, we must add the random value to the concentration. As follows, the random concentration value can be applied through the'[ics]' block:
```
[ics]
  [ic1]
    type=random
    dof=c
    params=0.6 0.66
  [end]
[end]
```
where the random value is applied via the `type=random` option. `dof=` indicates which DoF will be used. `params=` represent the parameters used in the initial condition calculation. For the `type=random` case, 0.6 and 0.66 are the min and max value of the random numbers.

# Parallel solver
In order to further speed up our simulation, we involve the parallel solver from either [mumps](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/) or [superlu_dist](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/superlu/). This can be defined via the `[nonlinearsolver]` block:
```
[nonlinearsolver]
  type=nr
  solver=superlu
[end]
```
where `type=nr` indicates the newton-raphson method. `solver=` determines the name of the parallel solver, in this case, the superlu_dist solver is used. It should be noted that, if external solvers, i.e. `mumps` and `superlu`, are not compiled within your PETSc, then you can only use the built-in solver. In short, this option doesnâ€™t make sense to you.


# Run it in AsFem
Now, let's try your fourth example in AsFem. You can create a new text file and name it as step5.i or whatever you like. Then copy the following lines into your input file:
```
[mesh]
  type=asfem
  dim=2
  xmax=4.0
  ymax=4.0
  nx=100
  ny=100
  meshtype=quad4
[end]

[dofs]
name=c mu
[end]

[elmts]
  [mych]
    type=cahnhilliard
    dofs=c mu
    mate=myf
  [end]
[end]

[mates]
  [myf]
    type=cahnhilliard
    params=1.0 2.5 0.005
    //     D   Chi Kappa
  [end]
[end]

[timestepping]
  type=be
  dt=1.0e-5
  time=3.0e3
  adaptive=true
  optiters=3
  growthfactor=1.1
  cutfactor=0.85
[end]

[nonlinearsolver]
  type=nr
  solver=superlu
[end]

[ics]
  [ic1]
    type=random
    dof=c
    params=0.6 0.66
  [end]
[end]

[job]
  type=transient
  debug=dep
[end]
```
